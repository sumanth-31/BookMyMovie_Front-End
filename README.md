## BookMyMovie

A Ticket Booking System, developed using ReactJs(TypeScript).

This is the front-end of the application and has been deployed on https://book-on-click.herokuapp.com.

Note that, due to subscription restrictions, initial request might take upto 1 minute as the servers are shutdown after 1 hour of inactivity on the developed website.

Back-End Code link: https://github.com/sumanth-31/BookMyMovie.

Features:

1) User-Friendly workflow.

2) Easy ticket-booking system.

3) Simple, yet elegant use-interface provided by bootstrap.

4) SSR provided by NextJs.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
